Hollo is a federated single-user microblogging software powered by [Fedify].
Although it is for single-user, it is designed to be federated through
[ActivityPub], which means that you can follow and be followed by other users
from other instances, even from other software that supports ActivityPub like
Mastodon, Misskey, and so on.

Etymology
---------

The name *Hollo* is a Korean word *홀로*, which means *alone* or *solitary* in
English.  It is named so because it is designed to be a single-user software.
